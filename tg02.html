                        In this course, we will embark on an exciting and comprehensive journey into the core principles and practices of modern web application development. We'll explore how to transform static websites into dynamic, interactive, and data-driven experiences that users can engage with in real-time. This class is designed for students with a foundational understanding of programming, but no prior experience in web development is required.

                    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
                        Unlike a traditional website that primarily serves static content, a web application is a software program that runs in a web browser. Think of social media platforms, online banking portals, or interactive mapping services. These applications require a constant flow of data and complex logic to function. Throughout this course, you will learn the fundamental skills required to build such applications from scratch.

                        Our focus will be on the two main components of web development: the front-end and the back-end. The **front-end** is what the user sees and interacts with. You'll master the "holy trinity" of web languages: **HTML** for structure, **CSS** for styling and layout, and **JavaScript** for interactivity and dynamic behavior. We will explore modern frameworks and libraries that simplify front-end development, allowing for more complex and maintainable applications.

                    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mt-4">
                        The **back-end** is the server-side, the engine room of the application. We'll delve into topics like server-side scripting, managing databases to store user data, and building APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow the front-end to communicate with the back-end. You will gain a solid understanding of how these two parts work together seamlessly to create a complete and functional web application.
